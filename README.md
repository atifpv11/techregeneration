## How it Works ?
The most important physics aspect is that Law of conservation of Energy.The vehicle utilises the fuel provided to burn and produce energy which is used to gain kinetic energy by overcoming the surface friction and air resistence.Then while stopping the vehicle the kinetic energy possessed by the vehicle is reduced to heat energy of the brake disk and the vehicle is stopped.Instead of this while stopping the vehicle the kinetic energy of the vehicle need not to be wasted as heat and friction rather while braking the vehicle could utilise the kinetic energy to turn the turbine of a generator which could help to create electrical energy which could be stored in a battery stored in the vehicle.Here also a large amount of heat energy is wasted by blowing it through exhaust pipe instead it can be utilised as steam which will help in rotating the turbine of a generator to produce electrical energy which will be stored in a battery.
